# Data Structures

Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science that enable efficient storage, organization, and manipulation of data. They are essential for designing efficient algorithms and play a crucial role in software development.

## Classification of Data Structures

Data structures can be broadly classified into two categories:

### 1. Linear Data Structures
Linear data structures store data in a sequential manner. Each element is connected to its previous and next element, forming a linear sequence.

- **Array**: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
- **Linked List**: A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next node.
- **Stack**: A collection of elements that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queue**: A collection of elements that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
Non-linear data structures store data in a hierarchical manner, allowing for more complex relationships between elements.

- **Tree**: A hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes forming a parent-child relationship.
    - **Binary Tree**: A tree where each node has at most two children.
    - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree with the left child containing values less than the parent node and the right child containing values greater than the parent node.
    - **Heap**: A special tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property.
- **Graph**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
    - **Directed Graph**: A graph where edges have a direction.
    - **Undirected Graph**: A graph where edges do not have a direction.

## Conclusion

Understanding data structures and their classifications is crucial for efficient algorithm design and problem-solving in computer science. Each data structure has its own strengths and weaknesses, making it suitable for different types of applications.
